# -------------------------
# Description: An example Play Framework application through Seed Template: https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
#  It doesn't use activator, as the  official support for the same will be discontinued by the end of 2017.
#  This image requires only scala and sbt installed, which are provided by the inherited image: hseeberger/scala-sbt.
# Git Repository: https://github.com/gaco/play-scala-seed-docker/
